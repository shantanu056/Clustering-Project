# Clustering-Project

In this project I have implemented three Clustering techniques on a single dataset and displayed the results.

The project proceeds in the following order-
  - Data Exploration
  - Data Cleaning
  - Data Clustering
  
The Clustering techniques used are as follows-
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - DBSCAN
